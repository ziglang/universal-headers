zig build
- should give you (in zig-out/bin): addHeaders, outputHeaders, testHeaders
- also shells out to diff


for the whole thing, run (for me this takes ~30min):
./src/textdiff/compile.bash headers/*

then to test (takes ~5min):
./src/textdiff/test.bash headers/*


What's going on:

1. addHeaders headers/foo
- takes files from foo
- normalizes them into uh_norm
- for each file:
    - adds context prefix to each line
    - outputs to uh_workfile
    - diffs with file in uh_workspace and modifies uh_workspace

2. outputHeaders uh_headers
- reads files from uh_workspace and outputs universal headers in uh_headers
- uses reductions.zig to reduce #if statements

3. testHeaders headers/foo
- partially evaluates uh_headers for version foo and outputs to uh_test
- can then diff uh_test uh_norm/foo
